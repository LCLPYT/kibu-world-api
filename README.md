# kibu-world-api
An extension for the [fantasy](https://github.com/NucleoidMC/fantasy) mod for fabric. 
Allows for world re-creation from the persisted level.dat file. 
Also serves as runtime world manager, which holds handles to all created runtime worlds. 
This mod is part of the [kibu](https://github.com/LCLPYT/kibu) modding library, but packaged in a separate mod to avoid third-party mod dependencies in the base project.
